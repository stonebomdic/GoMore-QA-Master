"""Dogfood test — runs the v0.8.0 headers_misconfig rule against the
Tier 1 vulnerable Flask fixture for real, asserts both:

  - POSITIVE: rule flags `/vuln/data` for missing headers + dangerous CORS
  - NEGATIVE: rule does NOT flag `/safe/data`

This is the gate that the v0.8 mobile rollout didn't have, per
`docs/v0.8-mobile-postmortem.md`. Mock-based tests catch orchestrator
regressions; THIS test catches "the rule is actually wrong about
what the world looks like."
