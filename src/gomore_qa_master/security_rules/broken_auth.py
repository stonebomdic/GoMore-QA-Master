"""OWASP API2 — Broken Authentication.

PR-3 of the v0.8.0 rollout. For each operation declared to require
auth in the OpenAPI spec, this rule sends a small set of
**intentionally-forged tokens** and watches whether the server lets
them through. A 2xx response to any of the forged probes indicates
the server isn't validating tokens properly — the OWASP API2
textbook bug class.

Tampering matrix (4 probes per auth-required op)
------------------------------------------------

| Probe              | What we send                                | Expect | Severity if 2xx |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|
| NoAuth             | no Authorization header                     | 401/403 | CRITICAL — no auth at all
| MalformedJWT       | `"not.a.jwt.at.all"` as Bearer              | 401/403 | MEDIUM — parser accepts garbage
| AlgNone            | hand-rolled `alg: none` JWT, admin claims   | 401/403 | HIGH — algorithm not pinned
| WrongSignature     | PyJWT-encoded with a random secret          | 401/403 | HIGH — signature not verified

A 4xx other than 401/403 (e.g. 400 bad-request) is treated as
"server rejected the token but not for auth reasons" — still
considered SAFE for this rule's purposes, since the server didn't
honor the forged credentials. Only 2xx counts as a finding.

JWT library decision (PRD §7.1)
-------------------------------

Picked **PyJWT** for v0.8.0 because:
  - already a transitive dep of the Tier 1 fixture (PR-1)
  - covers everything PR-3 needs (HS256 sign, decode with options,
    explicit algorithm whitelist)
  - simpler API surface than python-jose

`alg: none` tokens are NOT encodable through PyJWT 2.x by design.
The `_forge_alg_none_jwt` helper hand-rolls one with raw
base64-url segments. Same shape as a real attacker's tool would
produce.

Why we don't test 'expired token accepted'
------------------------------------------

Producing a validly-signed-but-expired token requires the SERVER'S
signing key, which a black-box scanner doesn't have. We can't
distinguish "server rejected because signature wrong" from "server
rejected because expired" without that key. Filed as future work
for an authenticated-scan mode where the user supplies a real token
and the rule can mutate just the `exp` claim while keeping the
signature valid.
