"""Smoke tests for gomore-qa-master.

Catches the "easy" regressions that an MCP catalog or first-time user will
hit before they get to a real test run:
- package imports cleanly
- the MCP Server() is instantiable
- list_tools() returns the full advertised surface (currently 21 tools)
- dispatch table covers every declared tool (no name typos / unwired tools)

Per issue #35: the QA / testing MCP should have a CI smoke test of its
own, otherwise "doesn't test itself" is a real credibility hit.
